===== UNSAT Core Extraction =====

Initialized VSIDS activities:
Var 3: 2.00
Var 2: 2.00
Var 1: 2.00
CDCLSolverIncremental initialized with 3 variables and 3 clauses.
Randomly selected var 2 (ratio: 1.00, random_prob: 0.10)
Decision: x2 = 0 at level 1 (ratio: 1.00, activity: 2.00, pos/neg: 1/1)
Unit propagation: x1 = 1 at level 1
Unit propagation: x3 = 1 at level 1
No unassigned variables left for decisions.
All variables assigned without conflict. Formula is SATISFIABLE.
Base formula is SATISFIABLE

Solving with assumptions {x1=true, x2=true, x3=true}...
Contradictory assumptions, formula is UNSAT
Result: UNSATISFIABLE
UNSAT core extracted: {2}
The core identifies the minimal set of assumptions that caused unsatisfiability.
This can be used for analyzing conflicts in larger formulas.

Testing without assumption x1...
Contradictory assumptions, formula is UNSAT
Result: UNSATISFIABLE
Testing without assumption x2...
No unassigned variables left for decisions.
All variables assigned without conflict. Formula is SATISFIABLE.
Result: SATISFIABLE
Testing without assumption x3...
Contradictory assumptions, formula is UNSAT
Result: UNSATISFIABLE

This demonstrates that the core correctly identified the minimal conflict.
