//This code implements the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, 
//a recursive backtracking SAT solver that incorporates unit propagation to simplify the formula.

/*
unitPropagation simplifies SAT solving by recursively assigning values to unit clauses.

A unit clause is a clause with only one literal, meaning its variable must be assigned 
a specific value to satisfy the clause. This process helps reduce the search space 
before backtracking, making solving more efficient.

Steps:
1. Scan the formula for unit clauses (single-literal clauses).
2. Assign the unit clause's variable to the required value (true/false).
3. Remove all clauses that are satisfied by the assignment.
4. Repeat until no more unit clauses exist.
5. Continue solving with a simplified formula.

/*
pureLiteralElimination optimizes SAT solving by removing pure literals early.

A literal is pure if it appears in only one polarity (always positive or always negative).
Since pure literals cannot contribute to conflicts, they can be immediately assigned
and all clauses containing them can be removed, reducing the search space.

Steps:
1. Scan the formula to identify all literals.
2. Find literals that do not appear in both positive and negative forms.
3. Assign pure literals immediately and remove affected clauses.
4. Continue solving with a reduced formula.

DPLL recursively solves SAT with two base cases:

It applies optimizations, picks an unassigned variable, and tries both true and false.
If neither works, return false (UNSAT).
